## Advertising
- Facebook events up
> All: initial discord pings
### Poster
- It's nice
- Can't be put up until we have a charity
- Gozz argues posting posters outside Cameron Hall may have no clear benefit and risks pushing us above capacity
	- Also no clear harm, could give Cameron Hall more exposure, and due to being a charity event that would be a win-win
	- Could be a pain if we approach capacity but that would be managable
- Posters to be delivered to Guild for posting in Guild Village
	- Posters to still be in Cameron Hall as usual
	- People may struggle to find Cam Hall
		- can help them, plus Gavin from the videos
> Jackie: finish poster work and distribute them
