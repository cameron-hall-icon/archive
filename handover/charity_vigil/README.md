## What is Charity Vigil?
Charity Vigil is an overnight charity fundraising event held in Cameron Hall, coordinated by Cameron Hall Clubs. Each club runs activities that allow for donations to be made throughout the night, and (although it is each club's choice to do so or not) often donate their fridge/snack income from the event's duration to the chosen charity as well.

This event is almost identical to Uncharity Vigil, with the one major difference being that rather than proceeds and event profit going towards the clubs, the proceeds and event profit goes towards charity.

The invitation to this event is extended to ICONs (at the time of this handover being: Unigames, UniSFA, UCC, Panto, UWAnime and PCS), and should already have a planned date from the annual ICONs planning meeting.

In 2021, Charity Vigil was run by Unigames, UniSFA, UCC and PCS. It ran the weekend going into study break, Saturday 03/04 - Sunday 04/04.

In 2020, due to the pandemic and lockdown, in lieu of Charity Vigil, an online version called "Charity Unvigil" was run online, over 4 evenings, Wednesday-Saturday, with the following schedule:
- Wednesday - Unisfa opens with movie night & Jackbox
- Thursday - UCC tech talks and games
- Friday - Unigames board games and RPGs
- Saturday - “Grand Finale” night w/ Minecraft and raffle drawing
- Ongoing for the week - PCS programming comp

UCC or PCS (idr who) set up an online donation portal, and the events were all run over discord. The multi-night format was chosen as pulling an all-nighter in your bedroom doesn’t have quite the same appeal as with your mates at uni.


#### Historically how much does this event raise?
- 2021 Charity Vigil: $2,058.17
- 2020 Charity Unvigil: $1,771.00
- 2019 Charity Vigil: $1,184.60
- 2018 Charity Vigil: $1,313.39
- 2017 Charity Vigil: uhhhhhh idk

#### When does this event run?
You should already have a date for this event from the annual ICONs planning meeting, but typically it's held the weekend before study break. This is because it's an overnight event, and it'd suck fucking shit if you pulled an all nighter and slept for all of Sunday and then had to go to uni again on Monday. that'd suck so bad.
Friday is also an option, but hasn't been used recently: although people are  more likely to be around on a Friday due to classes and work in the city, they are also more likely to have had a long day, and you kinda need people to be well-rested to keep the event running.

The other consideration with when is what times. In previous years its been 5pm to 10am, or slight variations: eg 4/6pm start or 11am finish.

## Choosing a Charity
In the past (and we recommend in the future) the Charity has been focused on the youth/ students and is local and small which means the money we donate genuinely makes a difference.

We want to be choosing charities that are both doing the things that we like, and are less supported, as we want our money to be making more of a difference, and it'll make a larger difference going to a smaller less supported charity.

In 2021, Alistair contacted **"Who Gives a Buck?"** from student guild to sort out the choice of charity.
*Who Gives a Buck?* is a non-profit UWA student organisation who researches charities and produces portfolios about these charities to possible collaborators (You!), and then helps out with the donation. This is great because it cuts out the research part of the event, and means we're working together w the Student Guild which is nice too! They also do a little bit of PR for us but it's minor. They misspelled Unigames 2021 iirc lol.

I recommend emailing them (find their facebook page for contact details) like as soon as there is a single subcom member because having a charity is required of any advertising we want to do.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3kLv7Vt.png)


**If you have to do charity research yourself.** uhhhh idk.
Look for local charities, make a list, write briefly on what each one does, what a donation does and their contact details/method of donation. Show this to the subcommittee and then contact them all?

If you're unsure and have enough time - putting a poll up in a facebook group: genuinely not a bad idea, and has been done before. Otherwise like I said before, look for charities that are focused on youth/students or are maybe struggling in now times.

We suggest contacting multiple charities at once so we’re not trapped waiting for a singular entity to respond. This means we could ask what they would do with the money, tell them about the event, and ask for a description of their charity to use for our advertising. Mentioning in the email that we are looking at multiple charities and that without a response we won’t consider them is also a good way to prompt them to actually engage (charities are pretty bad at responding to things, it’s pretty weird). Make sure to ask them for permission to use their name/logo in advertising too!


## Meeting #1
Because of how soon this event is after AGM season, you're going to want to do multiple things during meeting #1

**Step One:** assign some people to some roles!
as according to the subcom regs (which you should've read and approved in your first committee meeting), each subcommittee has people assigned to the three (quite self explanatory) roles of:
- Chair: chairs the meetings
- Minute-taker: takes minutes
- Whip: bullies people to make sure action items are done

**Step Two:** make sure every participating club has had their committee approve their subcom regs.
They should've been good and have done so already at their first meeting where they then appointed subcom reps, but it's good to double check. because sometimes they don't.

**Step Three:** actual event discussion! talk about what you want to happen at the event, make sure you have a decent plan in place and get people to go back to their own committees to make sure each club has events that they can run and contribute to the vigil.
(If needed: explanation of what exactly this event is goes here!)

Stress to subcommittee members that it is not their sole responsibility to run all the activities for their club - as it takes away from their ability to make sure the whole event as a whole is running smoothly.
However, they still do have to **ensure** that there is someone running the activities, and that this is known to the person. Do not tell your committee that an activity is going to happen, and then show up to the event confused when your committee members are angry that they just had to scrounge up the activity because nobody was properly assigned to running these things.

**Step Four:** give out some action items
really important ones are: all of the admin things in the section below, and a budget.
The budget is v fast (get the one from last year and modify) and get your subcommittee to approve, and then all participating committees. This is because the subcommittee does not have the power to spend money on their own without approval from all attending committees. (this is covered in the subcom regs!)
you're also going to want to get someone to start researching charities/contacting 
Get all of these done asap!!! all of the above are things ur going to want to be done before the next meeting (which will be in a week's time)

other action items to think about:
- graphic design (posters, event banners)
- timetable/event schedule
- event description
- activity descriptions
- talk to your committee re: things that were discussed/start discussing possie activities ur club can bring (this one's pretty important tbf lol)
- start sourcing raffle prizes!!

## The EMP & Other Admin Things
### EMP
super easy! find an EMP from a previous year and basically copy it. (I'll pop a link to the previous EMP here if i remember, but if not - bug older committee members about it. or just bug me. i'll probably still have access to it)
that's it...
if you know how to do an EMP already (i hope you do), this is pretty easy. Make sure to do loft booking + AHA form too!
### Loft Booking + AHA
Loft booking is done by emailing hello@guild.uwa.edu.au and ccing the soc president (soc-president@guild.uwa.edu.au) letting them know you'd like to book the Cameron Hall Loft during the event, with EMP to be submitted shortly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ldt3Tav.png)

You'll also need to complete an After Hours Access Form (AHA Form) which you can get from Student Guild (same place where guild finance is). You then fill out this form and hunt down the soc president or Tony to sign and you're all good to go!
You're also going to want to at least attempt to get after hours access to the guild bathrooms by emailling hello@guild.uwa.edu.au.

## Finances
Floats should be prepared in advance by a treasurer/ someone who knows what they are doing. Making sure someone qualified makes and communicates what is happening with the float is vital. It is also for the best if only one club provides the float, as that makes it easier to keep track of.

Prizes for the raffle are to be bought/ donated by the club without any expectancy of reimbursement as it is for charity and Unigames has always donated the revenue they make off their food to the Charity and strongly recommends all clubs that sell food do the same (they usually do). The only things we would recommend be reimbursed is printing as it can only be done by one club, and the float as it is only a float. Before any purchase is made where reimbursement is necessary, make sure both the subcommittee and all involved committees approve the motion.

I also suggest taking donations not through the normal money box - use jars! this way you have a way to track how much money activities are making, and it's a nice bragging point too.

All events should be monetised so be sure to track the money throughout the event and collect it all at the end ready to donate. We recommend moving the money to UCC’s account before transferring it to your chosen charity. A financial report in definitely necessary and should be passed on to the subcommittee and all involved committees. 

**Floats** are pretty easy to do ask your treasurer or your local forever trez in her heart jackie for help

### SOME IMPORTANT MONEY TERMS!
**Proceeds:** these are donations made directly to charity. This involves microtransactions during games, raffle income, the $5 entry, and any other money collected from the activities run during the e. Hence, the phrase "all proceeds go to charity". NONE of this money should be touched. This money can't be used for balancing expenses/income in the distribution.

**Expenses:** money that is spent on the event/activities. For charity vigil this will be exclusively the expense of the pizza run, physical raffle tickets and printing expenses. (Donations from clubs / clubs spending money on the raffle prizes are not expenses, and cannot be balanced by income.)

**Income:** money that is earnt from the event/activities, not including proceeds. This will be exclusively the buy-in price from the clubs and any income from pizzas. This is money that can be used in balancing expenses.

**Profit:** (Income-Expenses) > 0, profit will be donated to charity

**Loss:** (Income-Expenses) < 0, loss will be split through the agreed upon method. (arbritration process)

### Budget
the budget for this event is super easy! as there are not that many expenses/income streams that are "shared" (basically just entry, pizza order if that's happening, any printing expenses, raffle tickets). simply find the one from last year (or find jackie to find it) and modify!

## Advertising
Advertising is vital to running a successful event and generally looks like posters, Facebook events, and promotional posts on each groups page, as well as advertising through other social . We would recommend putting up posters as soon as the charity is confirmed and making sure the event is being spruiked in the room and emphasising the fact that it is a drop in drop out event. For promotional posts we would recommend spruiking the charity and what it does as well as showcasing the prizes for the raffle and interesting events. 
I also reccommend making sure it's clear what activities actually are: and making sure it's clear so people actually know what's going on :) !

Grafik Dezine has gotta be someone's passion, and below is some of the stuff ya gotta do:

#### Physical
TODO: posters
TODO: tell gate/door/guardians etc to hype and advertise the event

#### Digital
TODO: event description
example event description here (just find last year's)
schedule
discord/facebook announcements/events
post about raffle prizes before the event
announce what charity we are supporting

## What is your job as the subcommittee rep?
Your role as a rep comes with a set of responsibilities which include, if at all possible, being present for the event. However we understand that you are not superhuman so take the time to figure out how long you can realistically be awake for (nap before hand if possible) and arrange a few people to come later/ have time off so you always have someone awake in charge. Although it is always better that you can attend the event if you can’t or if you have to come late/ leave early just let people know so we can make sure there are enough people rostered on at each point in time.

As the rep it is your job to ensure successful collaboration and communication with the other committees not to run every event for your club. In fact if you’re stuck keeping your clubroom open and unable to help with collaborative events such as the pizza run or the raffle it can be detrimental to the event. Instead communicate with your committee and if possible outsource the events being run to other committee members/ gatekeepers. Something to consider is adding people who are running activities (that aren't on the subcommittee) to the subcom discord to ensure they're kept in the loop.

When picking a rep it is important to consider their availability- in 2018 it was a 6 club subcommittee which means finding a meeting time is hard and flexible availabilities is very important to keep the subcom functioning. Although coming to meetings is undoubtedly important it should by no means be the only form of communication- we recommend creating a facebook or discord group aside from a chat and using it to have intermediate discussion in between meetings **(remember passing by circular is a thing)**.

Other things that you have to care about is: sharing minutes with your committee as soon as they're published! I usually do this by sending them a copy of the minutes in an official group chat and then **also** uploading it to the committee shared drive/whatever clubs other than Unigames use.

Also important is following the subcom regs, and making sure you contribute to the event. as defined in the regs, it is a subcommittee member's duty to `Assist in the planning, organisation, set-up, running, clean-up, and resolution of the event;` - this means attending the event and helping set up **and** clean up the building afterwards!

## Raffle

A traditional event at Charity Vigil is the raffle which generally raises quite a significant amount of money. This event is largely dependent on the prizes.

![](https://i.imgur.com/nYVChnI.png)

message club sponsors asking for prizes ^^ like above

Prizes are to sourced by the clubs, via sponsors if possible. Generally there's no budget allocated (except for raffle tickets) for the raffle: it is the individual club's responsibility to source these prizes. Generally prizes are considered donations, and thus aren't budgeted.
The goal for prizes is for a range of reasonable value prizes (some really nice stuff and some still nice but not as nice stuff), and a good amount of it!
Prize quantity is important to make sure people *can* win something.

Posting the prize pool in advance is a very easy way to garner attention and hype!! so do it

WRT raffle tickets: making sure that there is one available at every "location" is important! (ie: door, unigames, ucc, unisfa) and making sure that whoever is in charge is spruiking it to the room!

## Pizza/Food Order
During Charity Vigil a pizza run usually happens. We recommend having two people on this and calling Dominos beforehand (we used to use a smaller business that was at Broadway but they fucked us over one time) . A pizza run is an easy way to make some money for the event, by asking a small amount more than the pizzas actually cost, and it makes sure everyone gets fed. Keep in mind that there should be a pizza float prepared beforehand, and that it should be kept separate. This year we had a list with the name, pizza, cost and whether or not a person had paid which was a useful tool in keeping track of everyone's order. We recommend having the pizza orders close a few hours into the event, as many people will not be there early, and to have the pizza selling happen at the door.

That being said though, with the ongoing pandemic it may be a smart idea to not have a communal pizza/food order: in order to limit the time period in which multiple people are all eating food (maskless)

PCS PIZZA ORDER FORM/SHEETS HERE: MIGHT NEED TO CONTACT A PCS COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR IT

## Activities
Activities are the lifeblood of Charity Vigil and each club should make sure they are running active, monetised activities throughout the Vigil (or at least one). An easy way of tracking this and making sure there aren’t too many noisy activities going on at the same time is using a spreadsheet like this one https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpPaEweZ3pZG1vJV2b5q83Z8MZECzKaDnHzyyVUZTYY/edit?usp=sharing. 
Make sure to block major activities, and activities which will be loud or disruptive as far in advance as possible to avoid clashes and make sure the night runs smoothly, however smaller scale activities needs to be on the spreadsheet.

NOTE ON MONETISATION: encouraging competition between members is a really easy way to get $$$ !!

**Unigames Activities:** For this aspect of the event reaching out to other committee members, gatekeepers and old guard will generally lead to a good spread of event. The only main concern in ensuring that the activities remain monetised and at least a portion of them are drop in drop out. Activities we've run before are monetised oneshots, planechase, monetised board games.

**UniSFA Activities:** In 2021, uniSFA ran these activities: screenings (w bidding), video game tourney, karaoke
feedback given suggested that the monetisation method of screenings should be reviewed: eg outbidding someone's donation to immediately change what's being screened, or having the time something is screened be proportional to the amount of money donated can be considered. (rather than getting stuck on a long movie even if people are willing to pay $$$ to change it)

**UCC Activities:** In 2021, UCC ran these activities: minecraft, vr games, screencheat, jackbox. these activities were all monetised by entry, however didn't get the same numbers as other club's activities. Suggestion: paying to vote for which game to play, paying to buy items in minecraft. definitely something to think about.

**PCS Activities:** In 2021, PCS ran an unprogramming contest and a "Gozz Rant". The unprogramming contest was monetised through entry, and paying for submission of questions. gozz rant was monetised through people bidding on the topic (gozz making valid arguments for why Scratch is the best programming language for 15 minutes straight).

**any other clubs??:** uhhh

Activities which we have wanted to run but have been unable to include debates/ rants however due to the main person running the event being unable to attend due to illness they were unable to run. To prevent occurrences like this happening in the future we recommend ensuring multiple people know what is going on with those activities and instructions for them being written up. 

If you have any new ideas for activities feel free to try them, as long as you have people available to run them (try to assign this to someone not on the subcommittee), new attractions are always great as long as you make sure you have an easy way to monetise and manage them.

## Set Up
A few days in advance make sure everything we need, such as float and raffle tickets, and make sure everyone knows where they are. 

milk run <-- this is a club's individual choice/responsibility but i'm always a fan of a morning/early afternoon milk run for overnight events.

## On The Day...
get table set up for door (tav side), guild side should have sign
Put a sign on the fire escape door saying they have to come through the other side, and close that door (it opens from the inside, this is still fire safe). The other set of stairs is where you should filter people through, and stamp people’s wrists (wrist so that if/when they wash their hands it doesn’t come off). 

**things at entry:** laptop(s) for pizza order, money/shit box with float, raffle tickets, safeWA qr code, physical sign in sheet, paper to track entry (for statistics later), stamp & inkpad (from unigames)

**COVID:** sign in via safewa, proof of vaccination, non student sign in, make sure theres hand sanitiser everywhere but especially at the entry!!!

print schedules and place them around the building!

## Pack Up
Yay! You’ve finished the event and are almost there the main things you need to do now are clean up and count the money. If you left early to get some sleep try to come back to help the poor bedraggled souls who stayed overnight. In terms of cleaning up split it up into rooms and communal areas and try to leave them in the state you found them- don’t be afraid to rope in whoever you can to help you (i.e. gatekeepers, enthused members). We recommend doing a round trip to make sure all the money has been collected from both communal and club specific fundraising measures (i.e. door, pizza). Collect food revenue from all clubs donating theirs and make sure the floats have been accurately tracked, and then reimburse the club/s for these as appropriate.

---

## Wrap Up Meeting
Wrap up meetings are important. It’s how we wrote this handover. It’s a good way to discuss what went well and what could improve so we don’t make the same mistakes next time. This meeting is generally quite long and tiring so try and keep everything as constructive as possible. If you can’t attach the phrase ‘next time’ to what you are about to say it’s probably good to consider it’s relevance. Make sure to minute all the comments (memory is bad) and write them up into a handover guide/ edit past ones to include the new information. Before this meeting you should discuss the event within your committee so that you can represent the club as best as possible. As memory is bad try and get all of this dones as soon after the event as possible so nothing gets lost and everything is as accurate as possible. 

Before the wrap up meeting, collect feedback! both from attendees and committee (these are different types of feedback: think of attendee feedback being for the outside face and committee being the inside face eg: organisation).
**For attendee feedback:** I recommend making a google form if you're bothered (find an old event feedback form from a previous event and adapt it!) and also just talking with people and taking note of what they say!
**For committee feedback:** bring it up in the committee meeting after the event and ask for feedback, people will usually have it! make sure to note this feedback down and bring it back to the subcommittee

With the power of the feedback from both atteendees and committees, and the knowledge/experience of running this event & any discussion that occurs during the wrap up meeting: you'll be able to update this handover!
make sure to add anything i've missed, anything new that pops up, just really anything important to this event. the goal in my personal opinion is that if we gave this handover to someone who's NEVER run charity vigil and NEVER been to one ever: they'd still be able to run the event successfully!
(and make sure to add to the file history to the top of the document!)
